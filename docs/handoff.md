# Session Handoff Log — Adaptive Workout App
# Written by /handoff at end of every session.
# Read at start of every session.

### 2026-03-29T00:00:00Z
**Completed this session:** Project initialized.
**In progress:** None.
**Decisions made:** See docs/decisions.md.
**Open questions:** Fill in docs/PRD.md before starting development.
**Next session:**
  Read: CLAUDE.md and this handoff entry.
  First task: Complete docs/PRD.md then run /preplan on first feature.
  Watch out for: Run /verify-build-commands after creating Expo project.

**Completed this session:**
- Reinstalled toolkit with updated notify-stop.sh (logging only, no osascript) and report-blocker.md (no osascript step)
- Analyzed workout_plan_v4.html and resistance-timer.html to understand the existing web app
- Conducted full requirements conversation (blocking + clarifying questions answered by JD)
- Created docs/PRD.md v0.2 from conversation output
- Discovered existing root PRD.md (v0.8) with more mature architectural detail
- Merged both into docs/PRD.md v1.0 — single authoritative PRD
- Logged all session decisions to docs/decisions.md (9 new entries)

**In progress:** Nothing — PRD is complete and decisions are logged.

**Decisions made:** See docs/decisions.md entries dated 2026-04-03. Key ones:
- Storage: SQLite + SQLCipher for MVP (PowerSync future)
- Audio: expo-speech (TTS) + expo-audio (ducking), platform default voice
- Voice input (STT): future only
- HR integration: future only
- Pre-session intensity dial: future only
- Cardio session execution: out of scope (no planned milestone)
- Post-session feedback: free-form text only for MVP
- Orientation: portrait only
- Mid-session exit: default to resume, End Session requires confirmation

**Open questions:** None — all PRD questions closed as of v1.0.

**Next session:**
  Read: CLAUDE.md and this handoff entry
  First task: Update docs/architecture.md and docs/constraints.md to match the
    correct tech stack (SQLite instead of powersync-sqlcipher; expo-speech +
    expo-audio instead of expo-av). Then run /preplan on the walking skeleton
    or Feature 1 (AI Onboarding) to begin implementation planning.
  Watch out for:
    - docs/architecture.md still lists powersync-sqlcipher — update before any
      schema or storage work begins
    - docs/constraints.md says "Audio: expo-av only" — update to expo-speech +
      expo-audio
    - Root PRD.md in the project root is superseded by docs/PRD.md v1.0 — it can
      be archived or deleted to avoid confusion, confirm with JD first
    - pre-commit-check.sh uses python3 which is not available on this Windows
      system; JSON validation falls back to node successfully

## 2026-04-03T13:03:21Z
**Completed this session:**
- Verified docs/architecture.md was correctly updated (SQLite+SQLCipher, expo-speech + expo-audio)
- Archived root PRD.md → PRD.md.archived
- Built docs/schema.md v1.4 collaboratively — all 6 MVP entities and 3 AI I/O contracts defined as TypeScript interfaces
- Built docs/planning-directives.md — 6 planning directives covering session structure, upper/lower split, muscle coverage, active recovery sessions, exercise ordering (HR management → equipment changes → consecutive muscle groups), and plan context record initialization
- Updated PRD §2.2 — added open-ended onboarding field ("anything else before I design your plan?")
- Updated PRD §5.1 — added analyzePlan as future placeholder
- Updated PRD §8 — added last-resistance-session-run indicator and free session selection note
- Updated docs/schema.md — added additionalContext to UserProfile, mobility/stretching to SessionType
- Updated docs/constraints.md — API key security policy and V1 proxy requirement
- Created developmentlog.md — portfolio artifact with full session history and design rationale
- Added Context7 MCP globally to ~/.claude/settings.json
- Bootstrapped Expo SDK 55 project: TypeScript strict, New Architecture enabled, portrait orientation, all stack packages installed (expo-router, expo-speech, expo-audio, expo-sqlite, zustand), src/ folder structure created
- Updated ~/.claude/settings.json permissions — Write(*) and Edit(*) globally to prevent agent permission prompts

**In progress:** Nothing — all doc work complete, Expo bootstrapped, ready for preplan.

**Decisions made:**
- planning-directives.md is the source for the generatePlan system prompt (separate from PRD)
- User-stated preferences always override planning directives
- analyzePlan deferred to post-skeleton; design it after seeing first AI-generated plan
- Mobility/stretching sessions: sequential timed holds, no circuit/rounds structure
- Between-round stretch absorbed into rest gap budget; skip rest countdown if remaining < 5s
- Exercise library (ExerciseDefinition table) deferred; name field is the future join key
- Exercise logging will be a separate ExerciseLog entity — not fields on Exercise
- API key: .env + .gitignore for MVP (solo local device); backend proxy required for V1
- Write(*)/Edit(*) permissions set globally — subagents need broad write access to temp/cache dirs

**Open questions:** None.

**Next session:**
  Read: CLAUDE.md and this handoff entry
  First task: Open a FRESH session and run /preplan on the Walking Skeleton (PRD §11).
    Full scope: hardcoded profile → AI generates single resistance session → SQLite store →
    execution runtime (timed circuit, TTS, audio ducking) → post-session feedback → home screen.
  Watch out for:
    - Put your actual Anthropic API key in .env before any AI layer work begins
    - Expo project is bootstrapped but App.tsx and index.ts are stock create-expo-app files —
      they will be replaced as part of the walking skeleton build
    - expo-router is installed but not yet configured — navigation setup is part of the skeleton
    - New Architecture is enabled (newArchEnabled: true in app.json) — all packages must be
      New Architecture compatible; flag any that are not before installing
    - Run /verify-build-commands after first real code is written to confirm build pipeline works
